## Abstract

Our project uses the Hotel Booking Dataset to create a machine learning algorithm to predict the success rate of the reservation. The dataset from Kaggle is originally from the article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets, written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019. This labeled dataset contains 119390 observations for a City Hotel and Resort Hotel from the 1st of July 2015 to the 31st of August 2017. We will be creating an artificial neural network using the independent variables: lead_time, arrival_date_year, arrival_date_month, arrival_date_week_number,  arrival_date_day_of_month, stays_in_weekend_nights, stay_in_week_nights, and adults to predict the dependent variable: is_canceled. Additionally, we will be using Logistic Regression as our second machine-learning method to predict is_canceled using the same aforementioned independent variable. By using Logistic regression and ANN, we hope to find which factors are the most important to predict if a person would cancel or not a reservation in a hotel which is represented in the dataset by the value = 0 when not canceled and value = 1 when canceled.
